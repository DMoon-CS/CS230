The Gaming Room is our new client that is working with us to devolop a game called Draw It or Lose It serving multiple platforms based on their based on the version they have currently on Android only.
Teams compete to guess what is being drawn while the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. 
It needs to have minimal lag and responsive so the game is fair and enjoyable while maintaing scalability so large groups can play. Security is always essential while also maintaing he ability to run on standard browsers. 
While creating the document i made sure to think of these things throughout though if i could revise it i would add more to the memory and storage system section to explain more about the process and things needed. Making sure to always try to understand the users viewpoint is vital as when we are on this side of things we can often lose track of things that matter to the users or how they might engage with our product.
